                We were all born with creative genes. Without knowing much about the world,
                we were once curious, advanturous, and full of questions. But since when did
                these fade away for some of us? Recent advances in machine learning and computer vision
                enhance the interests in designing technology that fosteres human creativity.
                However, the lies in the fact that our understanding for creativity remains so limited.
                Therefore, my research program intends to build theoretical groundwork
                for human creativity in computer-mediated environment and to offer implications
                for future applications accordingly. Based on theories across the fields of communication,
                information sciences, human development, and cognitive sciences,
                my research projects investigate the relationship between
                <span class="text-black">media affordances</span>
                and <span class="text-black">exploratory behaviors</span>

                the three key questions below through lab-based experiments,
                qualitative studies, and/or computational social sciences approaches:

                By observing and inquiring how users identity creative content online,
                the first phase of my research program studies how individuals acquires
                new information across computer-mediated platforms. This stage of the
                research informs how curated experiences in individuals’ digital life
                shape their concept toward creativity. Up to date, research in
                creativity relies on definitions elaborated by scholars and domain experts.
                However, to design user-centered applications that augment creativity,
                there is the need to understand what the greater population consider as creativity.
                To attempt this objective, I conduct a series of

                The second part of my research program focuses on how individuals
                leverage media affordances to generate creative products in novel experiences,
                including the encounter of a novel environment, a novel self, and a novel partner.
                In a preliminary study, <span style="color:blue">Surreal or Real</span>
                , I investigated how participants’ idea generation outcomes were influenced

                In the second project, <span style="color:blue">Embodied Genius</span>
                , I examined whether participants demonstrated behavioral differences
                when embodying in novel avatars of innovative characters (e.g., Albert Einstein).
                The third project, <span style="color:blue">Idea Bot</span>, assesses the effect
                of interacting with a novel partner on a brainstorming task.
                Through a series of three-staged online experiments, I tested whether the perceived identity
                and conversational style of an artificial chatbot influence participants’ creative production.

                How can creativity be further developed?
                Informed by the first two phases of my research program,
                "what is creativity?" and "how is creativity formed?",
                the final stage is to design prototypes
                which augment team creativity by introducing novel experiences
                that users cannot attain in their real life.
                Enlightened by a common technique – drawing with your undominated hand –
                that has long been used in free-hand drawing classes for inspiration,
                I have already been looking into a number of design ideas in our research lab
                include harnessing <span style="color:blue">homuncular flexibility</span>
                (e.g., making use of an extra arm, controlling hand movements with legs),
                <span style="color:blue">reversing time perception</span> in response to one’s movement
                (e.g., presenting slower motion and scene changes when participants move faster),
                <span style="color:blue">embodying in non-human objects</span>
                (e.g., embodying in a cube versus a humanoid avatar),
                <span style="color:blue">shifting points-of-view</span>
                (e.g., attaining a first-person versus third-person perspectives),
                and leveraging <span style="color:blue">the fourth dimension</span>
                (e.g., creating experiences similar to the 4D VR games and SuperHyperCube).
                By manipulating the tracked and rendered motions,
                these novel experiences can be created in VR. I am interested in investigating
                how participants could learn, explore, and adapt to these
                unexperienced features and to perform tasks and organize information more efficiently,
                and ultimately, how these experiencse can influence individuals' creativity,
                not only in the artificial world but also in the reality later on.
